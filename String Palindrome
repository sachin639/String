Problem statement
Given a string, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters.

Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequences of characters which read the same backwards and forwards.
Example:
If the input string happens to be, "malayalam" then as we see that this word can be read the same as forward and backwards, it is said to be a valid palindrome.

The expected output for this example will print, 'true'.
From that being said, you are required to return a boolean value from the function that has been asked to implement.




public class Solution {

	public static boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
		//Your code goes here
		String ans ="";
		for(int i=str.length()-1;i>=0;i--){
			ans+=str.charAt(i);
		}
		if(str.equals(ans)){
			return true;
		}
		else{
			return false;
		}
	}

}
